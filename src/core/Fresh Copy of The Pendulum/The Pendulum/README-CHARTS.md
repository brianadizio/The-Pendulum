# Custom Chart Implementation for The Pendulum

This document explains the custom chart implementation created for The Pendulum application as an alternative to using external dependencies like DGCharts (formerly Charts).

## Overview

Instead of relying on third-party chart libraries that may cause integration issues, we've created a self-contained chart solution with the following components:

1. **SimpleCharts.swift** - A lightweight chart implementation using Core Graphics
2. **AnalyticsDashboardViewNative.swift** - A dashboard view using our custom charts
3. **AnalyticsDashboardView.swift** - A compatibility wrapper for API consistency

## Implementation Details

### SimpleCharts.swift

This file contains a set of custom chart views that render directly with Core Graphics:

- **SimpleChartView** - Base class with common chart functionality
- **SimpleLineChartView** - Line chart implementation (for time series data)
- **SimpleBarChartView** - Bar chart implementation (for distribution data)
- **SimplePieChartView** - Pie chart implementation (for proportion data)

Each chart type handles its own rendering logic, data normalization, and styling. The charts are optimized for simplicity and performance without external dependencies.

### AnalyticsDashboardViewNative.swift

This is the main dashboard view that uses our custom chart implementation. It includes:

- Time range selection (session, daily, weekly, monthly)
- Summary metrics cards
- Multiple chart visualizations for different metrics
- Dynamic data loading based on the selected time range

### AnalyticsDashboardView.swift

This is a compatibility wrapper that maintains the original API while delegating to our native implementation. It handles:

- TimeRange enum conversion between different implementations
- API consistency for existing code
- Smooth integration without changing other parts of the app

## Usage

The dashboard view can be integrated into any view controller with minimal code:

```swift
// Create and configure dashboard
let dashboard = AnalyticsDashboardView(frame: view.bounds)
dashboard.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
view.addSubview(dashboard)

// Set up constraints
NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
    dashboard.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.topAnchor),
    dashboard.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor),
    dashboard.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor),
    dashboard.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.bottomAnchor)
])

// Update with specific data
dashboard.updateDashboard(timeRange: .session, sessionId: currentSessionId)
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No External Dependencies** - Eliminates integration issues with third-party libraries
2. **Full Control** - Complete control over the appearance and behavior of charts
3. **Lightweight** - Minimal impact on app size and performance
4. **Maintainability** - Easier to maintain as it only uses built-in iOS frameworks
5. **Customization** - Easy to modify for specific requirements

## Customization

The charts can be customized by modifying the following properties:

- **color** - The main color used for chart elements
- **title** - The chart title displayed at the top
- **dataPoints** - The data values to be visualized
- **labels** - Optional labels for data points

## Data Integration

The dashboard connects to the AnalyticsManager to load data for different time ranges. The integration points include:

- **Summary metrics** - Overall performance statistics
- **Angle variance chart** - Time series data of pendulum angle
- **Push frequency chart** - Distribution of time between user inputs
- **Push magnitude chart** - Distribution of force magnitudes
- **Directional bias chart** - Proportional representation of left vs right inputs
- **Learning curve chart** - Progress tracking over time

## Conclusion

This custom chart implementation provides all the visualization capabilities needed for The Pendulum application without relying on external dependencies. It offers good performance, full customization, and seamless integration with the rest of the application.
