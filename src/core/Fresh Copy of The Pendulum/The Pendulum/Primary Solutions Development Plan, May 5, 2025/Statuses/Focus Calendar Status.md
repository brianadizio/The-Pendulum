# The Focus Calendar - Project Status Report

*Last Updated: May 2, 2025*

## Current Status Summary

The Focus Calendar iOS application is in active development, with significant progress made on the core architecture and key components. The app currently has a functional UI framework, data models, and visualization components, but is experiencing build errors that need to be resolved before further development can continue.

### Recent Refactoring Progress

We have completed a major refactoring effort to resolve naming conflicts and structural issues in the codebase:

1. ✅ **Fixed Distribution Model Conflicts**: 
   - Renamed `FlowDistribution` to `GoldenDistribution` to prevent naming conflicts
   - Updated `DistributionManager` to use `GoldenDistribution`
   - Renamed conflicting `DistributionManager` in `DistributionGenerator.swift` to `DistributionGeneratorManager`

2. ✅ **Resolved Function Ambiguities**:
   - Fixed min/max function ambiguities by explicitly using `Swift.min` and `Swift.max`
   - Fixed trigonometric function calls by using explicit `Darwin.cos` and `Darwin.sin`

3. ✅ **Fixed Type Conversion Issues**:
   - Properly converted `FlowEntity` to `FlowModel` when assigning to variables
   - Fixed Type system property access using proper methods

4. ✅ **Fixed Optional Handling**:
   - Added proper unwrapping for color hex code values
   - Fixed optional value handling in Core Data entity access

5. ✅ **Simplified Complex Structures**:
   - Extracted complex views into separate components
   - Created dedicated files for complex visualizations like `FlowNetworkVisualization`

## Current Build Issues

The application is not yet building successfully. The main remaining issues are:

1. **ModesViewRefactored.swift Issues**:
   - Generic parameter inference errors
   - Property access issues in `SettingsManager`
   - Missing `customModeSettings` implementation

2. **Other View Complexity Issues**:
   - Several complex view structures are causing compiler timeouts
   - Need to further simplify these views by breaking them into smaller components

## Implemented Features

The application currently includes:

1. **Core Data Model**:
   - Focus, Goal, Flow, and Type entities with relationships
   - Entity management framework

2. **UI Components**:
   - Tab-based navigation
   - Views for Foci, Goals, and Flow management
   - Settings screens for customization

3. **Visualization System**:
   - Network graph for visualizing Foci and Goals
   - Distribution visualization for Flow patterns
   - Timeline visualization

4. **Data Management**:
   - CSV and JSON import/export functionality
   - Persistence using Core Data

## Next Development Steps

Based on the existing prompts and current status, here's the plan for completing the development:

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Fix Build Errors**:
   - Resolve remaining issues in `ModesViewRefactored.swift`
   - Fix `SettingsManager` property access and implementation
   - Break down complex views causing compiler timeouts

2. **Complete Core Functionality**:
   - Ensure all entity relationships work properly
   - Verify data persistence functions correctly
   - Test all CRUD operations on entities

### Short-Term Development (Next 2-3 Sessions)

1. **Enhance Flow Visualization**:
   - Improve network graph performance
   - Add animations for Flow transitions
   - Implement touch gestures for interaction

2. **Finish Type System Implementation**:
   - Complete UI for Type management
   - Add visualization for Type connections
   - Implement filtering and searching

3. **Polish Settings and Customization**:
   - Complete theme implementation
   - Add user preferences storage
   - Implement visual customization options

### Medium-Term Development (Next 4-6 Sessions)

1. **Data Analysis and Insights** (Prompt #8):
   - Implement statistical calculations
   - Create visualizations for insights
   - Add prediction capabilities

2. **Integration with iOS Features**:
   - Add notifications for Flow events
   - Implement sharing capabilities
   - Add widget support

3. **Advanced Visualization**:
   - Enhance 3D/2D rendering
   - Add animated transitions
   - Improve performance on older devices

## Reference Architecture

The app's architecture follows these principles:

1. **Model Layer**:
   - Core Data entities (FlowEntity, FocusEntity, etc.)
   - Business models (FlowModel, GoldenDistribution, etc.)
   - Manager classes (DistributionManager, FlowDistributionController)

2. **View Layer**:
   - SwiftUI views organized by feature
   - Custom visualization components
   - Reusable UI elements

3. **Controller Layer**:
   - ObservableObject classes for state management
   - Controller classes for business logic
   - Integration services

## Next Steps from Existing Prompts

The next prompt to implement is #8 - "Data Analysis and Insights":

```
Implement data analysis features for the Focus Calendar app:

1. Create statistical calculations for:
   - Focus distribution patterns
   - Goal connections analysis
   - Type relationship networks
   - Temporal patterns in Flow transitions

2. Design visualizations for these insights:
   - Charts showing Focus percentage changes
   - Heatmaps of Type connections
   - Progress indicators for Goals
   - Prediction graphs for future Flows

Use SwiftUI's built-in visualization capabilities and/or integrate a charting library like SwiftUICharts.
```

However, this should only be attempted after resolving the current build issues and ensuring the existing functionality works correctly.

## Implementation Strategy

To get the app back to a buildable state, we will:

1. Create a more simplified version of `ModesViewRefactored.swift` that avoids complex generic parameter inference
2. Implement proper property storage in `SettingsManager` for custom modes
3. Break down other complex views into smaller, more manageable components
4. Address each build error systematically, focusing on one file at a time

Once the app is building successfully, we'll continue implementing the remaining features based on the prompts, with a focus on data analysis and insights.

## Technical Debt

Areas that need attention:

1. **View Complexity**: Many views are too complex and need refactoring
2. **Manager Class Consistency**: Need to standardize the pattern across all manager classes
3. **Distribution Model**: The distribution system has redundant implementations
4. **Error Handling**: Need more robust error handling throughout the app
5. **Documentation**: Need comprehensive code documentation

## Conclusion

The Focus Calendar app has a solid foundation with significant progress on the core architecture. The current build issues are solvable with focused refactoring efforts. Once these issues are resolved, the app will be ready for continued feature development according to the existing prompts.

The app's unique approach to visualizing and managing personal focus areas, goals, and flows has the potential to create a powerful tool for personal development and life management as envisioned in Brian DiZio's description.
