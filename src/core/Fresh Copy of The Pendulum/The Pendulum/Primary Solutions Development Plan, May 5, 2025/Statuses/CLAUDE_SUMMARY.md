# Analytics System Integration Summary

## Current Status

We've successfully created the necessary components for the comprehensive analytics system in The Pendulum game:

1. **Core Data Model Updates**
   - Created `CoreDataModelUpdates.xml` with definitions for new entities: `InteractionEvent`, `PerformanceMetrics`, and `AggregatedAnalytics`
   - Created `AnalyticsModelStubs.swift` as temporary stub classes to allow compilation until Core Data model is updated
   - Modified `AnalyticsModelAdditions.swift` to comment out extensions that were causing build errors

2. **Analytics Manager**
   - `AnalyticsManager.swift` implements the core tracking functionality
   - Tracks user interactions, pendulum state, and calculates performance metrics
   - Handles data aggregation for different time periods

3. **UI Integration**
   - `AnalyticsDashboardView.swift` implements the detailed analytics visualization
   - `DashboardViewController.swift` includes toggle between simple and detailed views
   - Added conditional import for the Charts framework

4. **Core Integration**
   - `pendulumViewModel.swift` has been updated to record interaction data in `applyForce()`
   - It also tracks pendulum state in `step()` method and initializes analytics in `startGame()`
   - `PendulumViewController.swift` initializes analytics tracking in `viewDidLoad()`

## Next Steps

To complete the analytics system integration, follow these steps:

1. **Update Core Data Model in Xcode**
   - Open `PendulumScoreData.xcdatamodeld` in Xcode
   - Add the new entities from `CoreDataModelUpdates.xml`

2. **Post-Core Data Update**
   - Remove `AnalyticsModelStubs.swift` once Core Data model is updated
   - Uncomment extensions in `AnalyticsModelAdditions.swift`

3. **Add Charts Framework (Optional)**
   - Add the Charts framework for enhanced visualizations
   - Use Swift Package Manager: `https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts.git`

4. **Test the System**
   - Run the app and play a session
   - Check the Dashboard tab and toggle to detailed analytics view
   - Verify that data is being recorded and displayed

Detailed setup instructions are available in `ANALYTICS_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## Features Implemented

The analytics system now provides:

1. **User Interaction Tracking**
   - Records timestamps, angles, reaction times, and push patterns
   - Tracks pendulum state continuously throughout gameplay

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Calculates stability scores, efficiency ratings, and directional bias
   - Determines player style based on interaction patterns

3. **Long-term Data Persistence**
   - Stores daily, weekly, and monthly aggregations
   - Tracks skill development over time with learning curve analysis

4. **Enhanced Dashboard**
   - Visualizes all collected analytics data
   - Provides both simple and detailed views

Once fully integrated, this system will provide deep insights into player behavior and skill development.
