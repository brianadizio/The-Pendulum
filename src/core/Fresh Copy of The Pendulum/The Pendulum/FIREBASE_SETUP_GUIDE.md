# Firebase Setup Guide for The Pendulum

## ✅ Firebase SDK Installation Complete!

You've successfully added Firebase to your project via Swift Package Manager. The following Firebase modules are now available:
- FirebaseCore
- FirebaseAnalytics
- FirebaseAuth
- FirebaseCrashlytics
- FirebaseDatabase
- FirebaseAI

## 🔥 Next Steps

### 1. Add GoogleService-Info.plist

**IMPORTANT**: Firebase requires a configuration file to work properly.

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Add an iOS app with your bundle identifier
4. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file
5. Drag it into your Xcode project (make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked)
6. Ensure it's added to your app target

### 2. Test Firebase Integration

1. Build and run your app
2. Go to Settings > Developer Tools
3. Select "Test Firebase Integration"
4. Run the tests to verify everything is working

### 3. Firebase Test Features

The test interface allows you to:
- ✅ Verify imports are working
- 🔐 Test anonymous authentication
- 💾 Test Realtime Database read/write
- 📊 Test Analytics event logging

### 4. Console Output

When you run the app, you should see Firebase initialization messages in the console:
```
🔥 Initializing Firebase...
✅ GoogleService-Info.plist found at: /path/to/plist
✅ Firebase configured successfully
✅ Analytics test event logged
```

If you see an error about missing GoogleService-Info.plist, follow step 1 above.

### 5. Firebase Features Available

With the current setup, you can:
- Track user analytics and custom events
- Authenticate users (anonymous, email/password, social logins)
- Store and sync data in Realtime Database
- Monitor crashes with Crashlytics
- Use Firebase AI features (Vertex AI integration)

### 6. Troubleshooting

If Firebase tests fail:
1. Ensure GoogleService-Info.plist is in your project
2. Check that the bundle ID in the plist matches your app
3. Verify you have an internet connection
4. Check Firebase Console for any setup issues

## 📱 Integration Points

Firebase has been integrated into:
- `AppDelegate.swift` - Initialization on app launch
- `FirebaseTestConfiguration.swift` - Test utilities
- `FirebaseTestViewController.swift` - Interactive test UI
- `DeveloperToolsViewController.swift` - Developer menu option

## 🎯 Ready to Use!

Firebase is now ready to enhance The Pendulum with:
- Cloud data storage for leaderboards
- User authentication for profiles
- Analytics to understand player behavior
- Crash reporting for stability
- AI features for enhanced gameplay

Happy coding! 🚀
