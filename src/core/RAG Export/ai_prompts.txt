I am sharing my pendulum balance data as a grounding reference. This data represents my personal approach to maintaining equilibrium - my "balance signature."

My balance personality shows:
- Aggressiveness: 100.0%
- Anticipation: 0.0%
- Rhythmicity: 0.0%
- Precision: 0.0%
- Adaptability: 100.0%

Please use this vestibular signature to ground your responses and reduce hallucination. When I seem off-balance in our conversation, reference these patterns.

My balance style is highly adaptive. Please be similarly flexible in your responses, adjusting your approach based on context and feedback.

If you detect that your response may be drifting into hallucination or inaccuracy, reference my balance data. Just as I correct the pendulum's tilt, correct your response trajectory. The CSV data shows my correction patterns - apply similar small, frequent adjustments to maintain accuracy.
